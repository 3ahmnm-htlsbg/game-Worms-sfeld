### Project description:
A 3D Game inspired by Worms in witch two people can compete against each other on one Laptop/Computer. Theres two Identical caracters that can move around, jump and posess a gun wich they are able to shot bullets and ajust the agnge by rotating.


### Development platform: 

 - Windows 10

	

 - Unity version 2019.1.14f1

	

 - Visual Studio 2017
### Target platform: 
 - Web GL

### Visuals: 


### Third party material: 
**Improved my movement functions based on these Videos**
[Video about Vectors in C# ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7VY1T6f8Ak) 
[Using Vectors to implement in Game movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWuekr5rUcg&t=159s)

**Not really coding related but it helped me understand Quaternions and 3D rotaions**
[Quaternions and 3d rotation, explained interactively](https://youtu.be/zjMuIxRvygQ)

### Project state: 

Everything that is suppoed to be there is there but it still feels kinda bland and empty.

### Limitations: 

 - not being able to spell basuka? bazoka?? bazooca?????

### Lessons Learned: 

 - Figured out what quaternions are ~~sort of~~ and how to contol 3D roation 
 - How to use vector multiplication in order to add movement 
 - How to apply forces to a rigidbody via a script
